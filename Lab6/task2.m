% Considering different symbol interval ts, plot frequency response of
% the channel. Is it an FIR/IIR?

% What is effect of increase/decrease of symbol interval related to delay
% spread?

% Find the output samples when a signal of symbol duration ts is
% passed through the channel.

% Use Toeplitz representation of convolution to recover transmitted
% signal.

% Transmit a sinusoidal signal of frequency 1 KHz over this channel.
% Plot the output signal.
