% Use the delay profile from 5G ETSI document Table 7-7-2.1 TDL-A
% page 64 to generate a channel Rayleigh fading channel. Use Matlab
% rayleighchan(). Use fd=0 and delay spread 100ns.


% Show that the channel is indeed Rayleigh by plotting histogram of
% magnitude of channel gains.

% Use histogram to show that the channel gain is Gaussian.
